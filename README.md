# Andre Infante

*ML researcher & game developer focused on VR and teleoperation.*

I build model‑driven interactive systems, robots, and odd little games. Below is a selected portfolio, split by focus area. Blurbs are intentionally brief, first‑pass notes.

## 🤖 Robotics

- **[Neo — 1X Technologies Inc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVcBa6NXAbk)**  
  Work with the Neo humanoid platform; teleoperation and model‑assisted behaviors, focusing on reliability and embodiment.
- **[ACT‑driven simulated mobile manipulator](https://twitter.com/AndreTI/status/1780665435999924343)** — personal project  
  Policy learning with ACT in sim for pick/place and navigation; emphasis on data‑efficient control loops.
- **[Tree‑Based LM Sampler for URL Prediction](https://github.com/AndreTInfante/ConstrainedLMSampler)** — personal project  
  Constrained decoding tool to keep LMs on valid action/spellout graphs; useful for robotics planners with discrete schemas.
- **[scriber — continuous‑learning transcription app](#)** *(video TBD)*  
  Human‑in‑the‑loop ASR with rapid incremental fine‑tuning hooks and dataset curation for downstream embodied tasks.

  Early SD video tests: keyframe‑to‑video, interpolation, and stylization explorations.
- **[Sector Security](https://youtu.be/9Ozr2EQlMW4)** — personal project  
  Small technical prototype; realtime systems/controls flavor demo in a sci‑fi wrapper.
- **[Machinima Ad Campaign (GameStop)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wndPeMYi6v0)**  
  Production/technical direction for a machinima‑driven ad spot; engine capture and post pipeline.
- **[Pregame Prognostifications Of The Pigskin Wyzzard (Adult Swim)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATfGpIQEHj8)**  
  Technical/creative contribution to a surreal football prognostication bit; realtime/engine workflow.
