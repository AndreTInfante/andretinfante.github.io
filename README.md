## ü§ñ Robotics

- **[Neo ‚Äî 1X Technologies Inc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVcBa6NXAbk)**  
  At 1X, I worked extensively on the teleop system for NEO. I also worked on new model architectures and features, refining and optimizing a mujoco simulation framework, and using VLMs for user interaction and low level policy orchestration. 
- **[ACT‚Äëdriven simulated mobile manipulator](https://twitter.com/AndreTI/status/1780665435999924343)** ‚Äî personal project  
  Policy learning with ACT in sim for pick/place and navigation. Built a full stack sim robot controller, teleop system, and data processing pipeline for training. See codebase [here](https://github.com/AndreTInfante/act-mobile-manipulator-test-datastripped-02)

## üß∞ Software

- **[Scriber ‚Äî continuous‚Äëlearning transcription app](https://youtu.be/S0wsxpnubdM)** 
  Human‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚Äëloop ASR that continuously fine-tunes on corrections in the background, allowing quality to improve as you go.
- **[Horizon Worlds ‚Äî Avatar Legs (Meta)](https://www.meta.com/experiences/2532035600194083/)**  
  At Meta, I worked on avatar animation and embodiment improvements and shipped procedural avatar legs and performant fake avatar shadows, plus a ton of bug fixes.
- **[Minion (Minion AI)](https://twitter.com/ai_minion)**  
  At Minion, I explored using VLMs and multi-level control interfaces for browser automation.
- **[Video Generation using Stable Diffusion (2022)](https://imgur.com/a/1utP3VC)** ‚Äî personal project  
  Early SD video tests, experimenting with generating videos from the latent space of fine-tuned models.
- **[Sector Security](https://youtu.be/9Ozr2EQlMW4)** ‚Äî personal project  
  Quest 2 game prototype built around a novel locomotion system.
- **[The FOO Show / FOO VR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/411820/The_FOO_Show_featuring_Will_Smith/)**  
  At FOO, I built a real-time networked VR virtual production tool that we used to make an interactive talk show (briefly the best-rated free VR title on Steam), several GameStop commercials and a show for Adult Swim.
  - **[Pregame Prognostifications Of The Pigskin Wyzzard (Adult Swim)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATfGpIQEHj8)**  
     Adult Swim web cartoon made using my/FOO's virtual production pipeline for Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, in a live production capacity.
- **[Tree‚ÄëBased LM Sampler for URL Prediction](https://github.com/AndreTInfante/ConstrainedLMSampler)** ‚Äî personal project  
  Constrained model decoding tool to allow a model to predict URLs that are guaranteed to be valid from a known whitelist.

## üéÆ Games

- **[Lords & Language Models ‚Äî single‚Äëplayer, model‚Äëpowered D&D](https://lordsandlanguages.onrender.com)** ¬∑ [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXaFiu2Wayg)  
  Solo TTRPG powered by LMs; uses structured output to integrate rigid, mechanical game elements with language model flexibility.
- **[One Night Ultimate Werewolf (B√©zier Games)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobieos.karan.Wolf_Android14_11_13&hl=en_US&gl=US)**

- **[Cards Against Machinery](https://andretinfante.itch.io/cards-against-machinery)** ‚Äî personal project  
  Lightweight, multiplayer Cards Against Humanity clone, using ~10^6 AI generated cards for variety. (NSFW)
- **[Jar Wars (Farbridge)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1095060/Jar_Wars/)**  
  Playful VR arena shooter. Joined as a contractor towards the end of development and helped out with optimization and bug fixes to get it over the launch finish line.
